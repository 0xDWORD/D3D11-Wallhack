# So you released your ESP and like to tell noobs to fuck off:

Weebs acting like they invented the internet and C++ when you look at the credits of their cheats. Weebs thinking that this is world of science. However, it seems like they are mixing some things up. In the science world, citing someones work actually means something.

People of science contribute and teach each other. Unlike the cheater community. Which is mostly made out of bitter young boys who are very proud that they learned to walk. They are so proud of their first steps in the programming world. They want to keep all that special leeb haxor knowledge to themselves. Because it came with a price! They had to spend time learning and everybody were so mean against them :(. 

But now weebs have internet credits which enable them a special language of LULZ, KIKS and KEKS. They can share screenshots and earn reputation points at haxor forums. But from time to time, some bigger Weeb will call them a retard. It will act as an reminder. That they are still a small piece of shit and have a long way to go in the LULZ community to become the most respected dick of them all.

Meanwhile, at the code department, every weebs code looks like a centipede made out of sticks and shit tied together.
